## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's root directory called "Animal_Shelter_Api.Solutions"
4. Add a .gitignore file to root directory.
5. add obj, bin, and appsettings.json to .gitignore file.
6. Within the production directory "Animal_Shelter_Api", create a new file called appsettings.json.
7. Within appsettings.json, put in the following code, replacing the database, uid and pwd values with your own database name, username and password for MySQL.

### Add a New Future Pet

Add a new future pet to the animal shelter.

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:5000/api/futurepets`

When making a POST request to http://localhost:5000/api/futurepets/, you need to include a body. Do not include the futurePetId as that is auto generated upon creation.

### Update Future Pet

Update details of an existing future pet.

**Endpoint:** `PUT http://localhost:5000/api/FuturePets/{id}`

**Path Parameter:**
- `id`: ID of the future pet to update.

When making a PUT request to http://localhost:5000/api/futurePets/{id}, you need to include a body that includes the pets futurePetId property. Here's an example body in JSON:

```json
{
  "futurePetId": 9,
  "name": "Dale",
  "age": 2,

### I decided to try adding CORS to my API. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and it's used to allow requests from specific origins(domains). Here's a step by step of my process.

1. I installed the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package.
``````
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors
``````
2. I added a CORS policy to my Program.cs using the AddCors() method.
``````
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddDefaultPolicy(builder =>
    {
        builder.AllowAnyOrigin()
               .AllowAnyHeader()
               .AllowAnyMethod();
    });
});
``````
3. Added Use CORS middleware to my Program.cs before the mapping controllers

``````
app.UseCors();
``````
4. To test if CORS was working I used a testApp that I made earlier in the week following a tutorial for CORS and made a call to my API.
5. Kept getting a ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR and figured out I need to change the FetchRemote to http instead of https from the tutorial.
6. All the data was returned to the test app index page which makes sense since I have the policy set to AllowAnyOrigin.
7. Changed my AddCors method to the following to change to specific origin:
``````
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddDefaultPolicy(builder =>
    {
        builder.WithOrigins("https://example.com") 
               .AllowAnyHeader()
               .AllowAnyMethod();
    });
});
``````
8. Got the following error as expected:
``````
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/futurepets' from origin 'https://localhost:8081' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
``````
9. Currently the policy is configured to allow any origin, any header, and any HTTP method. This is useful for development but might be overly permissive for production environments. You would adjust the CORS policy to match the application's security requirements after development.
