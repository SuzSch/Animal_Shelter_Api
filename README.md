![Picture of two cute dogs with a cute cat between them. The dog on the left is a corgi with a yellow bowtie on. The cat in the middle is grey and they are looking over their sholder at the camera. The dog on the right looks like a huskey cattle dog mix. They are in a meadow of yellow flowers with the sun setting behind them.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lVY6xmuPCl_j6jDFz1PjbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTM2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/dog_time_927/d56c8a78d352ed6a1ea2d506e200e130)
